# Wireframes

For wireframing and viual structuring of my website's layout and design, I chose to utilize [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic"). This tool allowed me to meticulously plan for a user-centric interface, ensuring that the experiance remains consistent and accessible on various devices. My goal throughout the design process was to prioritize ease of use and maintain a cohesive aesthetic from one to the next.
